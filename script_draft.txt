Delivery3:

Delivery4:

	"You're approaching... Did you make a circle? The house is identical to yours. A familiar smell hits your nose, only reminding you of despair."
	"You climb this familiar staircase, instinctively stepping over a loose step. You should have fixed it a long time ago."

	"Darkness: And break out of here. Live."

	"You quickly run away from your own house - and see your car on the street."
	"Turn of the key - and the engine explodes with a roar, making the whole car shake with anticipation."
	"There is nothing holding you back in this city. There's no point in dying here."

	"Voice: Brain functions stabilized, dynamics online."
	"You feel a very distant touch, as if you were touched through a hundred quilts."
	"Voice: Are you still a fighter, John? I'm glad you got out in the end."
